<p> Hello everyone, <br>
<br>This blog was created to chronicle my journey of becoming a cloud professional. You may notice I used the term <i>professional</i> as opposed to cloud architect or cloud developer. My study approach ahs been to learn about about different areas of working in the cloud before I decide which aspect I will focus my studies on. I look forward to joining the community and learning alot!
